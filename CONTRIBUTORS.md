# ContractCase contribution instructions

ContractCase welcomes contributions!

If your change is major, or you'd like to discuss it before starting work, please open an issue to
avoid having to rework your hard work.

### Maintainer documentation

You can find maintainer documentation for all ContractCase modules and
packages [here](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/tree/main/docs/maintainers).

The [package structure](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/blob/main/docs/maintainers/PackageStructure.md)
documentation is an important starting point, as it describes the functionality of each package.

Any guidelines in those instructions also apply here. If any information is missing, or you have
further questions, please open an issue.

### Java DSL specific things

This is the Java DSL package. New additions and code changes here should exclusively be for making
the use of ContractCase idiomatic in Java / the JVM ecosystem.

If your change is broader, please put it
in [one of the other packages](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/blob/main/docs/maintainers/PackageStructure.md),
which you can find in the same
repository ([here's a link to the readme](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case#contractcase-contract-testing-framework)).
